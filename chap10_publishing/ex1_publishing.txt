Go through the process of signing your application and generating an APK through Eclipse
(Optionally) Publish an application on the Android Marketplace

Publishing requires us to self-sign our application.
    Eclipse has a signing wizard built-in
    Select File → Export → Android → Export Android Application
    Verify project name and click Next
    Select Create a new Keystore and pick any location and any password.
    Type "DistributionKeyStoreAlias" as alias, enter 30 years of validity and name. Hit Next
    Choose an APK file path and hit Finish

Publishing can be done through several deployment methods.
    The easiest is to use the Android Market
    Visit http://market.android.com/publish/Home to register for a Google developer account (costs $25)
    Enter information and complete the process
    Click the Upload Application link to start the upload
    Select APK file and upload screenshots and information
    Enter app title, description, website, etc
    Hit Publish to complete the uploading of your app.
