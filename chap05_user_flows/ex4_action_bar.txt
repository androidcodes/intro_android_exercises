Build an action bar with 2 icons
First icon when clicked should print a toast message
Second icon when clicked should bring up a second activity
Home icon on second activity when clicked should take you back to first activity
  Hint: Use "case android.R.id.home" to handle home click
  Enable setHomeButtonEnabled on ActionBar to enable home button click
Action Bar should read 'Click an Icon' as the title
