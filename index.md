## Intro Android Exercises

The goal of this project is to complete a series of exercises that are designed to reinforce our Android concepts. This project is appropriate for someone just starting out with Android development and is following along with the CodePath Android curriculum.

TODO: More information on the exercises

### Getting Started

Let's create an Android project that we can use to complete our exercises!

**Goal**: Create a new Android project

**Description**

Welcome to Android development!  We're going to explore Android concepts by following the various instructions in these text files.  In this first step, we will create the Android project that we will use for the rest of these exercises.

The "New Project" wizard will contain options not specified below.  Unless the directions below say otherwise, you may accept the default options.

**Directions**:

1. Open Android Studio, and select File->New Project.
2. Choose an application name, as you want it to appear when it is installed on a phone.
  - Note: It's ok to keep the default Company Domain for now.
  - In the future you might want to use a more accurate value for your Company Domain.
3. On the next step, set the minimum SDK to 15.
4. When you add an Activity, you should use the default template, a Blank Activity.
5. Run your application
   - It should launch in the emulator
   - Should display "Hello World" on a white screen.
6. You're done!

#### Choosing SDK versions

Minimum required SDK: In the world, Android phones are running many different versions of Android. You need to select the minimum version that you will support. The lower the version, the more difficult it is to support because it will not have features of later versions. Unfortunately, many phones are unable to update their Android versions.

Use this site to help choose what the minimum required SDK version should be: [Android Dashboard](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html)

As of right now, if you choose to support API level 15 and above, 91.8% of phones will be able to install your application.
